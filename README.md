### This is a fun web application ultilizing the following technologies:
* Node.js 
* Express.js 
* jQuery 
* MySQL 
* Handlebars 

#### How it works 

When a user visits the page, they can fill out a form for a burger that they'd like to eat. Examples: 
* Pepper Don't Preach burger 
* I Mint to Do That Burger
* The Jack-O-Lentil Burger 


When users click the submit button, the burger is added to the database and also displayed on the screen. Then, they have the option of devouring the burger by clicking the devour button.


I used the [Smash Burgers website] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.punchh.smashburger&hl=en) as inspiration for the UI, and [Bob's burgers] (https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/every-burger-from-bob-s-burgers-ranked) for the burger names.
